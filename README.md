🧭 Direction Estimation of Indoor Localization using IMU Sensors and GNSS Data 📡

Accurately estimating the direction and orientation of indoor localization systems is a crucial aspect for enhancing user experience and enabling precise navigation. Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my exploration in this exciting field!

Project Overview:

In this repository, I present my research and development efforts in creating a robust and accurate model for Direction Estimation of Indoor Localization. Leveraging the power of deep learning, I've designed a sophisticated deep neural network that combines accelerometer and magnetometer data with GNSS information to predict the heading angle with respect to the local north direction.

Key Features:

🧠 Deep Learning Model: My approach utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture comprising 1D convolutional layers and self-attention blocks. This model extracts meaningful patterns from raw sensor data, improving prediction accuracy.
🔄 Filtering Techniques: To enhance the quality of sensor data, I've implemented advanced filtering methods such as the Butterworth filter, moving average filter, and circular median filter. These techniques help reduce noise and artifacts, leading to more reliable predictions.
🌐 Integration of GNSS Data: By incorporating GNSS data, I've created a supervised learning framework that learns from both sensor readings and ground truth. This integration strengthens the model's ability to handle different indoor environments and scenarios.
🚀 Continuous Improvement: I'm dedicated to continuous experimentation and innovation. I'm actively exploring novel architectures, experimenting with different pre-processing techniques, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve results that surpass the baseline model's performance.
🌟 Flutter App: I've created a Dart-based Flutter app for data collection. Fixed sampling rate ensures reliable data. Feel free to redevelop, experiment, and contribute. Let's innovate together! 💡
